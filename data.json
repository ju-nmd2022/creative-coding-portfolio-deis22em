At first I wanted it to be the entire original Schotter artwork that would be flying around, but with each frame the squares are updated and changing position, which made it look glitchy, and not a look I was going for so I decided to do a simple square. Still keeping pretty much the same code as OG Schotter, but without the randomization, and jitter, etc. And this is where we ended up."
